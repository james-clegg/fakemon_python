# Fakemon

### Concept

Fakemon is a battling simulator based on the Pokemon series of games, played in the terminal. It is my first introduction to both OOP and Python, and is oriented around putting the SOLID principles into practice.

### Project status

Fakemon is currently a work in progress. Players can choose from any of the first 151 pokemon and a random moveset will be generated for them from the applicable moveset for that pokemon. Players can then battle with these pokemon until all of one team have fainted at which point the turn player is declared the winnner.

### Installation instructions

##### Prerequisites:

* Need Python 3 installed on your machine.
* Clone down the repository.

##### Instructions:

* Navigate to the fakemon directory
* Run the command - `python3 battler.py`

### Reflections

I started this project as a way of learning OOP and Python simultaneously. Having come from a JS webdev background I hadn't been particularly exposed to OOP, so wanted to learn a new paradigm. Additionally, there's a number of projects I'd like to try and build that would suit being written in Python, so I thought this could be an interesting way to solve both issues at once.

The project has certainly highlighted the importance and difficulty of planning ahead effectively, particularly with OOP. I could have saved a number of logistical headaches on this project by planning more effectively, and by now adopting the mantra of 'measure twice, cut once', there has been far fewer backtracking changes, which has made actually writing the code much quicker.

The SOLID principles have made tracking down and diagnosing bugs significantly easier. In particular, the single responsibility principle has made logic errors much easier to solve as I'm only looking in one place and everything is rendered much more simplistic.
